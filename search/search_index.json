H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda de Marina Martes 11 de febrero de 2025, 11:00h Sala de reuniones de DACYA (233 A) Resumen In control engineering, formation control scales by focusing on local geometric constraints with neighboring-agent interactions, while natural systems (e.g., insect swarms) seem not to care much about precise geometry but rather prioritize global spatial distributions, forming flexible shapes with dynamic agent densities. Traditional formation control prioritizes precise local relationships;however, this strategy introduces fragility, as a single agent failure can trigger a significant snowball effect. In contrast, biological systems appear more resilient to individual failures and achieve flexibility through loosely defined global patterns. In this talk, we introduce dispersion formation control\u2014a strategy that shifts focus from controlling local variables to regulating the eigenvalues of the multi-agent spatial covariance matrix. By targeting global dispersion metrics (e.g., variance) rather than enforcing rigid local geometries, individual agent impacts are diluted across the swarm. This swarm-like approach enhances resilience, as agent failures perturb global statistics minimally, unlike traditional multi-robot systems where local errors can cascade. The strategy balances adaptability with robustness, aligning more closely with biological collectives. H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda de Marina Peinado Investigador Ram\u00f3n y Cajal. Universidad de Granada. Hector Garcia de Marina received the M.Sc. degree in electronics engineering from the Complutense University of Madrid, Spain, in 2008, the M.Sc. degree in control engineering from the University of Alcala, Spain, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in systems and control from the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in 2016. He held a Postdoctoral position with the Ecole Nationale de l\u2019Aviation Civile, Toulouse, France, from 2016 to 2018. From 2018 to 2020, he was an Assistant Professor at the UAS Center, University of Southern Denmark. In 2020, he was a Research Fellow at the Complutense University of Madrid. Currently, he is a Research Fellow with the University of Granada, Granada, Spain, under the Ramon y Cajal program. His research interests include the guidance navigation and control for autonomous robots and multiagent systems. He is an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Robotics.
