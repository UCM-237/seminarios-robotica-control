####Resumen

In control engineering, formation control scales by focusing on local geometric constraints with neighboring-agent interactions, while natural systems (e.g., insect swarms) seem not to care much about precise geometry but rather prioritize global spatial distributions, forming flexible shapes with dynamic agent densities. Traditional formation control prioritizes precise local relationships;however, this strategy introduces fragility, as a single agent failure can trigger a significant snowball effect. In contrast, biological systems appear more resilient to individual failures and achieve flexibility through loosely defined global patterns.

In this talk, we introduce dispersion formation control—a strategy that shifts focus from controlling local variables to regulating the eigenvalues of the multi-agent spatial covariance matrix. By targeting global dispersion metrics (e.g., variance) rather than enforcing rigid local geometries, individual agent impacts are diluted across the swarm. This swarm-like approach enhances resilience, as agent failures perturb global statistics minimally, unlike traditional multi-robot systems where local errors can cascade. The strategy balances adaptability with robustness, aligning more closely with biological collectives.
